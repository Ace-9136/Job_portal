## Prerequisites

Before you can get this project up and running, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Django: You need to have Django installed. You can install it via pip with the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install django
    ```

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-portal.git
    cd job-portal
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment for the project to isolate dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the project, you need to configure some settings. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the following environment variables:

```plaintext
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

Make sure to replace `your_secret_key` with a strong, unique secret key. You can generate one using the `secrets` module in Python.

Additionally, configure other settings such as email, media storage, and third-party services as needed.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following commands from the project root directory:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

This will create the necessary database tables, create a superuser for the admin panel, and start the development server. You can access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials.

The main job portal can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000/`.
